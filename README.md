# Rehab-play-Project
A lot of people face up problems with upper extremity due to many reasons like stroke, problems with nerves brain part problems, or even injuries can cause them, and unforunately it ends that there's no way for short treatment and only way for healing is the rehabilitaiton techniques.
" Rehabilitation feels repetitive and boring ", " Rehabilitation takes time ", etc..., We realized the main darksides of the rehabilitation treatments so, we decided to uncover the darkness of it and let it shine again by providing **an engaging, effective, reliable, and a measurable way that helps to shorten the time, improve performance, cost cheaper, and interesting to let them keep going with it** and that's by **providing 3 interactive games that's enough to measure all parameters that help patient recovered faster, and effectively** .
# Our project
We have built a 3 VR games that are divided into 3 modules : **Velocity, range of motion, and reaction time modules** using Unity game engine Ver. 2022.3.15F1, and blender,
and **created a haptic glove for measuring fingers and hand angles and connected it with the games**.
After a lot of research and a final scoping review from 4004 research paper, the VR has proved that it actuallt leads to great results due to the engagment 
that helps neuroplasticity of the brain cells to work much better and help rehabilitation faster, in addition to the enjoyment and positive energy that gained while playing.
# Module 1: Velocity Training & Assessment :
In this module, we created a 3d room with interactive shapes that has a floating clone in a far small distance (based on the level) and the patient is required to move the shape from its place and move it to its clone.
At this action we measure many parameter such like distance, velocity, path trajectory, fingers and hand angles. 
The distance is determined based on the level, level 1 about 39 cm , level 2  about 50 cm, and level 3 about 100 cm.
At the end of each level, we generate a report for the doctor so he can see the improvement of the patient, his performance log , and all measured parameters.

# Module 2: Range of motion game Training & Assessment :
In this module we added to our environmenr a large bookshelf and the patient is required to get a specific book that illuminates a light from the spcific shelf.
The shelf height from the ground is determined based on the level.
Aim of that is to help patient move their arms up, which helps in calculating the range of motion of shoulder movement.
After finishing the game we celebrate the patient with butterfly confetti and give a report for the doctor about the overall performance.

# Module 3: Reaction time game Training & Assessment : 
Human reaction time is a critical parameter that can tell us a lot of information about brain health and body too.
As our main project is for rehabilitation then it would be an impoertant factor.
In the assessment mode there's only one lamp infront of you and you are required to hit it as fast as possible when it changes its color.
Assessment mode helps us in determining the training level that we would start from or even he wouln't need to have training.
In training mode we created a specific are on the wall of the room and in this region there's a lamp that suddenly appears infront of the patient.
The patient is required to hit this lamp when he see it to increase his score.
There's many modes for the game like "Fixed delay", "Speed up", and "No delay" that patient can choose between them based on doctor's referal.
